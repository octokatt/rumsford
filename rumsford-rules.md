Stacking
In most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies.
Modifier Types
Since modifier types are not explicitly described in this system, only those bonuses that clearly are of a different type the general rule is that unless the nature and source of a modifier is distantly different do not stack.  Factors that contribute to a dice pool, usually a Trait, rarely benefit from more than one modifier.    

Stacking Merits
Can you use more than one Fighting Style maneuver or other Merit in a single attack? Sometimes. The following rules apply.
1.  If nobody can explain how the maneuvers would stack in the story, it doesn’t work. The player needs to describe an action that brings them together. Your two-pistol backflip neck breaker’s probably going to sound dumb — unless you can somehow make it sound amazing.
2.  The required equipment or other circumstances for all maneuvers used must be present.
3.  You can’t stack Fighting Merits that penalize one of your character’s traits more than once, or impose the same disadvantage more than once. For example, you cannot stack two Merits that lower Defense, even if they cumulatively would not reduce Defense below zero.
4.  You can’t stack maneuvers that use different dice pools, unless changing the dice pool is a benefit the Merit specifically confers. For example, you can use Fighting Finesse with maneuvers that require Strength + Weaponry, and they’ll use Dexterity + Weaponry instead, but you can’t combine a Merit that uses Weaponry with one that uses Brawl.
5.  When stacked maneuvers provide the same benefit, the higher of the two apply. All disadvantages apply (though remember that you can’t stack maneuvers that impose the same disadvantage twice). Note that when two maneuvers provide the same result by different means, they do stack, so the Rote benefit (re-roll failed dice) does stack with bonus dice.
Multiplying
	Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you’re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (×2) and a double (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).

	When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. 

Target Number of 8 everything. 
Any Dice you roll if it returns a value of 8 or higher is a success. 



Combat
GMC rules. One roll.

Attack Pool
Strength or Dexterity + Relevant Skill -Defence.		
Each success deals 1 damage.



Damage Points 
Weapon + Successes from attack - Armor.

Defensive Options
Full Defensive: Double your Base Defense and you roll that pool vs attacks to negate them but perform no other actions

Health/Wound Penalties/Incapacitation/Death 
Characters have a number of Health boxes equal to 5+Stamina
When their 5th to last Health Box is filled in with Damage they take a -1 penalty to most actions. Each successive Health Box filled in with inflicts another -1 penalty up to a -5 penalty when the last Healthbox is filled in. Resistance rolls are not affected by Wound Penalties
When all a Character’s Health Boxes are filled in with Bashing Damage they must roll Stamina every turn to remain conscious. Failure causes them to fall unconscious until they heal a point of damage. 
When all a Character’s Health Boxes are filled in with Lethal Damage they are dying. Every minute they do not receive medical attention they upgrade a point of Lethal to a point of Aggravated Damage. Even if the Character receives medical attention they remain bedridden/in a coma until they heal at least their rightmost Health Box
When all a Character’s Health Boxes are filled with Aggravated Damage they are dead. 

Healing
Once stabilized your character recovers from Damage at the rates listed below. 
The Medicine Skill can be used to stabilize wounded characters or help them downgrade damage/heal faster
http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/wod2.0/CreationSkM.html#Med 
Bashing: 1 point/15 minutes		Lethal: 1 point/2 days		Aggravated: 1 point/week




Willpower
Only one Willpower point can be spent per turn to achieve any one of the following effects.
You can spend a point of Willpower to gain a +3 modifier on a roll during a turn. Only one dice pool can be affected per turn, and the Storyteller may determine that some rolls cannot be modified in this way. You cannot spend a point of Willpower to gain a bonus on a degeneration or Morality roll.
A Willpower point can be spent to add two to your character's Stamina, Resolve, Composure, or Defense to resist mental or social/emotional pressures asserted on him, or to make a concerted effort to avoid being harmed.

For Four actions, do you really want to go there?  I don’t.

Social Maneuvering and Coercion

Goal: Determine the character's goal. If their goal is reasonable, proceed. If not the attempt automatically fails.

Shifting Goals: If the characters shifts their Goals any open Doors remain so but the number of total Doors is recalculated based on the new Goal. If the victim finds out more information about the Goal that changes their opinion it counts as a shifted Goal. 

Doors: Determine the number of Doors that stands between the character and his goal.
+1 Door for every point of (lower of Resolve/Composure)
+2 Doors if the goal constitutes a breaking point for the victim
+1 Door if the goal prevents a victim from resolving an Aspiration
+1 Door if the goal opposes the victim's Virtue

Impression: The Storytellers determines the first impression the victim has of the character. This is due to all kinds of RP variables. The impression determines how frequently the character may roll to open Doors. 
Perfect (1 roll/turn)
Excellent (1 roll/hour) 
Good (1 roll/day)
Average (1 roll/week)
Hostile (Can only do Force rolls, not Maneuvering)
A victims impression can be increased. The character must learn about their victim, perform an action that would make the victim have a better impression. This always requires a roll.
Leveraging a person's Vice to tempt them can move the character up one level of Impression if the victim gains Willpower from it. 
Gifts, bribes and promises of service can increase the Impression by a step. This usually requires the equivalent of a Merit for the duration of the agreement. 

Maneuvering Doors Open: At each interval determined by the limitations of Impression the character can roll as part of an interaction with the victim. Success opens one Door. Failure imposes a cumulative -1 on further rolls. On a failed roll Storytellers can choose to worsen the Impression by a level and gives the character a Beat. 
If the character convinces the victim he will help fulfill a victim's Aspiration a door is opened. The character doesn't need to follow through but must convince the victim of his sincerity and capability. If the character has an opportunity to advance the victim's Aspiration and backs down two Doors close. 
Maneuvering Autofail: Maneuvering can automatically fail three ways
The character rolls a dramatic failure on an attempt to open a Door (and receives a Beat)
The victim realizes he is being lied to or manipulation. Doesn't count if he was aware from the start that the character was trying to talk him into something, only if the victim feels betrayed or conned.
The Impression level reaches "Hostile" and remains so for a week in game. The character can try again next story.

Forcing Doors Open: The character states their Goal and immediately rolls. The current number of Doors is a penalty to the roll. If successful the character makes the victim go along with the goal. If the character fails the victim is immune to further attempts to manipulate or coerce them. 
The character can also force breaking points on the victim such as threats, drugging, intimidation, blackmail, kidnapping and other illegal coercion. However to gain a benefit the victim must suffer a breaking point due to the action. If the breaking point roll has a penalty of 0 to -2 the action opens one Door. If the breaking point roll has a penalty of -3 or greater the action pens two Doors. 

Influencing Groups: When influencing groups use the highest Resolve/Composure of any member of the group. The group also is assigned three Aspirations and overall Virtue and Vice and relative Moral Code scores. Some individuals may leave rather than go along with the consensus, but the majority will go with the flow.

Successive Manipulations: Each successful Maneuvering removes one starting Door for subsequent attempts to manipulate the victim. 
A failure to Maneuver a victim or if Forcing the Door was used the victim adds two Doors to subsequent attempts.
These bonuses/penalties are cumulative. No matter what, a victim always has one Door.

Aspects and Anchors 
Aspects represent the personality of the character,  Acting on the aspect in a meaningful way recovers a single Willpower point. Acting on the aspect in way that is deeply meaningful, troublesome or requires sacrifice refreshes all Willpower, 

Rather than selecting from the set lists of Virtues and Vices during character creation, the player should define one Virtue and one Vice for their character in conjunction with the Storyteller.Both Virtue and Vice should be adjectives that describe dominant personality traits.  Likewise the Nature of the character is the word which best describes their core of their personality. 

Every Character has a Nature, Virtue and Vice.  Other possible aspects can be player created by the player to fully flesh out the character.  Suggested aspects include Goals/Milestones, Troubles, Bond/Touchstones, Demeanor/Masks, Doom, robots*

Conditions


DETACHED 
When a ghoul spends too long away from regular mortals, she runs the risk of behaving like something less than human. She becomes cold, lacks empathy, and starts viewing mortals as resources to be utilized. A detached ghoul suffers a –2 die penalty to Social rolls when in the company of mortals. 
Possible Sources: Spending a number of days equal to your character’s Integrity without regular human contact.
Resolution: Spending a full 24 hours away from anything supernatural.
Beat: Whenever the ghoul’s detachment causes a negative social situation.

DISCONNECTED
Your character has suffered a setback on her Pilgrimage, something that’s shaken her self-confidence in her ability to complete her Magnum Opus. She feels disconnected from humanity, and as such suffers a –2 modifier on all Social dice pools when interacting with normal humans.
Possible Sources:Facing a step backwards.
Resolution:Complete a milestone.
Beat: Whenever the character’s detachment causes a negative social situation.




Energy
energy refueling rules for custom power stats.  
Almost every template will have a power stat and and energy score. The name is an exact nature of these very depending upon the template.

Most energy pools are larger than willpower. However energy is refreshed much slower and inconsistent rate. Willpower also regenerate with rest, Energy does not.

If a character is full will power pool and Activates an aspect completely in such a way that they would refill their willpower pool, the player may instead game one energy from this action.  This represents their Self-actualization, the character realizing one's full potential. The different templates may restrict the aspects that matter and how often energy can be gained through self-actualization.  A player may gain energy once per session. 

Templates:

Heroic
“Legend”	(Heroic template of awesomeness)	[Extraordinary + Will + (Sacred + Fate)]
This template of a hero, able to do incredible things blurring the lines between extraordinary and supernatural. Through which luck, strength of character, and inner fortitude as well as writers contrivance and supernatural ability allow the hero to accomplish great things.

The energy for this template has several nicknames because it's really a spiritual mental abstraction.  

Conviction regained for this template when the hero: 
lives up to the moral their moral code, does what's right in face of peril or requiring willing sacrifice. 
Meets their virtue gaining conviction instead of willpower.
Self Actualization - Gain willpower when willpower pool is full, this representing self-actualization not petty indulgence. Vice fulfillment will not gain energy for this template.
Engages in the spiritual meaningful. Meditation, prayer, or introspection.
Intensive training that pushes you.  Gain as many successes as your dots (dice pool) in an extended action.
Heeds the call of adventure. – This is a compel.
Saves an innocent. – This is a compel.
Archetypal heroic behavior.
This energy can be used in several ways.

Heroic energy can be used as willpower. If the player wishes to spend willpower in the same turn as well as using here early energy it is possible so long as the augment different things.  Could be used to boost a dice pool all the other boost defense for resistance, Or ignoring penalties.
When the character heeds the call, or is acting heroic; in these situations they can spend, surrender a point of willpower to gain a similar amount of conviction.  


Certain character abilities may be powered by energy.

Magick (Gnosis)							[enlightened][magic]
mana does make working magic easier. As the mage reinforces his spell with the power of reality, it bends the cosmos more smoothly. Each Tradition has its own views on what, exactly, mana is and why it serves as a power source like this. 

Using Magic: Casting an improvised spell requires the expenditure of a point of Mana, unless the primary Arcanum used is one of the mage's Path Arcana.
Sympathetic Spells: Casting a spell upon a target beyond sensory range requires the expenditure of a point of Mana.
Aggravated Damage: Mages must spend a point of Mana for a spell to inflict aggravated damage. The mage must first have the prerequisite Arcana dots to cast an aggravated effect.
Power: Channeling mana into an Effect can increase the power of a spell.  Mana does not make it easier to cast a spell, only makes it grander and more powerful.  Mages must spend a point of Mana however these dice are rolled after the results are known.  Extra dice from mana are then used to increase the effect. 
Pattern Restoration: Mages can infuse Mana into their physical Patterns to heal wounds. The cost is three Mana points per one bashing or lethal wound. This is an instant action. Those mages unable to spend more than three Mana per turn can take as many consecutive turns performing this action as they need, until they've spent all three points. (It will take at least three turns for a mage with Gnosis 1, two turns with Gnosis 2, and one turn with Gnosis 3 or higher.) This is a reverse effect to Pattern scouring. The number of times a mage can spend Mana to restore his Pattern within the same 24-hour period depends on his Gnosis. At Gnosis 1-4, he can do so only once. With Gnosis 5-6, he can perform two Pattern restorations per day. With Gnosis 7-9, he can do three, and Gnosis 10 allows him to perform up to four restorations per day.


Mana can be regained through these specific actions

* Mages who perform an oblation (a ritual function associated with Path) at a Hallow can gain Mana points. Doing so requires an hour of uninterrupted ceremony and a Gnosis + Composure roll. Each success provides one Mana. Mages cannot gain more Mana per day, however, than the Hallow's rating. The ceremony should express the symbology of the Path, such as a ritual to recognize the solstices and equinoxes for Acanthus, or a rite of remembrance for the ancestors for Moros.
* Mages who perform an oblation outside of a Hallow can still gain Mana points though it is much harder. Doing so requires an hour of uninterrupted ceremony and a Gnosis + Composure roll. 3 success provides one Mana. 

Mages can scour their own Patterns to free up Mana. or so you’ve read.  Sounds painful and nasty.
Resonators 
People who absorb the resonance of their environments. 
Powers that Dispel or absorb the powers of Non-Essence users are half as effective as those which do not depend on the spiritual essence to accomplish the effect. . 
As their resonance levels build it becomes harder for them to void a resonance that becomes increasingly part of themselves. 
Synergy								[enlightened][astral][magic]

Synergy is a form of mystic understanding this represents not only enlightenment but connection to the creative unconscious, the akashic records and past lives, the personal Godhead.

Mana can be regained through these specific actions

Interactions with the astral plane.
An exceptional success with Meditation.
A moment of understanding or enlightenment inspired in another or experienced by yourself  
Greater harmony with the full parts of your self, the collective unconscious and the astral records.
Any action which would give a mage manna will probably yield a point of mana.
Self-actualization - Fulfill and Aspect when will power pool is full.  Realizing one's full potential not petty indulgence. Vice, and demeanor fulfillment will not gain energy for this template.

Inspiration								[‘enlightened’][Psionic]
Inspiration the mad rush of understanding, the brilliant insight the few can comprehend. Inspiration represents all this and more.  As a characters inspiration grows the uncanny and supernatural insight expands beyond the limits of the human mind. Their scientific breakthroughs are literally not scientific but brilliant insights of a mind.

Energy can be gained in these ways:
Expiring a truly unique experience.
A genius can harness their self actualization to yield greater inspiration. As such when they were would fulfill an aspect Willpower in excess of their pool they may convert on a one-to-one basis to inspiration.
The Eureka Moment. A brilliant insight, or very clever idea.  
Research! Conducting meaningful research will yield inspiration this will take time usually hours and days if it's going to be a long-term research the genius can gain inspiration for every extended roll. Inspiration is gained when meaningful data is produced from the research.
Art! Creaking a worthy work of art will yield inspiration this will take time usually hours and days if it's going to be a long-term research the genius can gain inspiration for every extended roll. Inspiration is gained when meaningful data is produced from the research.
Monolog – explaining the full extent of your brilliant plans to somebody can be used to gain Energy the greater the risk and the more complete the information that you reveal the more energy you gain.  Teaching a class or revealing information that poses no great personal risk will you will you one energy. Teaching this information in a way which might pose a risk or you true understanding will give you more.
Building new tech.  Inspiration is gained when meaningful progress is made to completing the research
Self-actualization - Fulfill and Aspect when will power pool is full.  Realizing one's full potential not petty indulgence.  Any Aspect fulfillment will gain energy for this template.


Primal Urge - Rage Focused essence					[Rage] [Spiritual]
Spent Essence points can be recovered by a variety of means. Primal Urge determines the maximum number of points a character can have (see the chart under Primal Urge).

A character may draw Essence from a locus, a place where the interplay between the physical and spirit is particularly powerful.
Certain rites performed by a solitary berserker or members of a pack can restore exhausted Essence points.
Certain rites performed by a solitary berserker or members of a pack can restore exhausted Essence points. Among them is a ritual combat made meaningful by a rite that venerates Different gods, Death, Mankind, War, spirits or existence itself, and rejuvenates participants' bond to the spirit world.
Self-actualization - Fulfill and Aspect when will power pool is full.  Realizing one's full potential not petty indulgence. Demeanor and Bond fulfillment will not gain energy for this template.

This type of spirit can gain essence from Rage.  Strife, stress, pain, frustration and conflict all fuel the Rage.  When the character is experiencing these situations they can spend, surrender a point of willpower to gain a similar amount of essence.  

* Combat: Having one's life in danger is definitely a stressful situation. Combat is always assumed to be stressful.

* Pain: Any injury that inflicts at least 1 damage.  Further injury in the session qualifies if the damage is greater than before. 

* Impending Danger: This can cover anything from a rock about to fall on your character's head (provided she's aware of it) to a truck hurtling down a sidewalk in her direction.

* Frustration: If a character just can't succeed at something while pressure.

Shapeshifters

The Form bonuses are broken. modified in this way 
Werewolfs to not regenerate in warform at the rate listed in the core book.  Uratha in Gauru form regenerate lethal damage as if it were bashing.
Only Apply half of Defense to Firearms attacks to forms which grant evasion.  
When devouring flesh from a helpless victim the Shifter may spend a point of Essence to ingest flesh and spirit.  For every point of damage caused by an Uratha’s bite, they can choose to ingest the flesh and gain a point of Essence.  This cannibalism is not the same as a normal bite attack in combat, which does lethal damage. This act is always a breaking point. 

Sympathy
Sympathy is a state in which a character becomes attuned and affected by the energies of the world around them. This is a heightened state, compared to what normal mortals experience. It is more akin to the state the spirits are in, but since they embody it they do not even realize they could be any other way. A mortal however, does and the conflict between the mortal and the world the mortal Sympathizes with is measured by the Moral Code Cohesion. 

Character’s Resonances are more easily detected by those with the proper abilities. This aids others to detect both the characters own Resonance and those Resonances they have absorbed
Character gains a bonus to certain rolls relating to feeling others feelings, engaging in an argument of pathos, sensing their true natures, detecting a Resonance. This ability cannot be turned off but certain Merits/Flaws may negate it to a degree. 
Characters eventually are affected by Resonances more strongly. The Absorption effect adds to the Dosage of any encountered Resonance.

Essence can be gained in these ways:

Self-actualization - Fulfill and Aspect when will power pool is full.  Realizing one's full potential not petty indulgence. Demeanor, Vice and Bond fulfillment will not gain energy for this template.  This does not add resonance. 


A character may draw Essence from a place where the interplay between the physical and spirit is particularly powerful.  A node, Locus, Hollow, etc.  This source will add resonance.  Such palaces are almost always guarded by powerful beings. 


This type of spirit can gain essence from spiritual meaningful expenses.  When the character is experiencing these situations they can spend, surrender a point of willpower to gain a similar amount of essence. Meditation, prayer, or introspection may work as will certain rites.


Some beings have the ability to take essence from areas with strong spiritual resonances.  This rare practice is known to alter the user in strange ways.

Resonance Strength translated to Effects			Influence Rules

+1 (Strengthen): Danny is strengthened when taking actions in line with the Resonance and weakened when opposing it. Danny gains a +1 die bonus to specific actions that fall under the aegis of the Resonance and a -1 die penalty to specific actions that oppose the Resonance

+2 (Resist): Danny is influenced to increase or decrease an already present influence to its next logical step. Danny gains Armor against opposing influences equal to the Resonance's Level.  The resistance of an essence does Not provide armor for things of it’s own nature.  
Examples: Fire’s armor influence at +2 will resist cold. Danny could still burn.  Death armor will protect from Life effects like an infection or parasite.  Death’s resistance will also ‘protect’ danny from outside magical healing effects.  Death’s resistance will do nothing to stop necrotic effects, necromancy or negative energy.  Death’s resistance after all will do nothing to hamper Danny from becoming dead or undead, after all that’s a natural expression of essence of death.

+3 (Control): Danny feels compelled to act under the Influence when appropriate. Danny gains a die bonus to specific actions that fall under the aegis of the Resonance and a die penalty to specific actions that oppose the Resonance. Both are equal to the Resonance's Level. This replaces the +1 (Strengthen) effect.

+4 (Mold): Danny is compelled to act under the Influence in situations even when there is no logical stimulus. The Resonance adds +1 die to an applicable Trait (Attribute dots, Health, Size, Speed) and subtracts -1 to an applicable Trait ((Attribute dots, Health, Size, Speed). If a Resonance reaches this level of Influence over Danny and is incompatible with Danny's nature it is a breaking point for Cohesion.

+5 (Shape): Danny is compelled to act under the Influence in situations even when there is no logical stimulus. And when he does, local spirits gain a die bonus to absorb Essence from the act equal to the Resonance's Level. The Resonance adds +/-3 to applicable Traits (Attribute dots, Health, Size, Speed). This replaces the +4 (Create) effect

+6 (Accept): Danny naturally acts in accordance to the Influence. Danny is accepting of outside influence of the Resonance Type without resistance or diminishment. Outside abilities of the Resonance Type gain a number of bonus successes added to a successful action, a magnitude factor, equal to the half Resonance's Level.  Alternatively Danny can now be targeted by spells and abilities that only affect things of that Resonance Type.
Examples: A Fire accepting Danny burns as if he were kindling.  He also is brighter and warmer.  A fire accepting danny could be targeted by Force [Fire) Arcana and manipulated by flame effects.  Fire shield, fire agility, and fireball. 
A Danny who is Death screwed has a spirit that welcomes necromancy and negative energy while natural healing slows. A Death accepting Danny could targeted by the Death Arcana.
Spiritual screwed Danny could be targeted, abjured of warded as if he were a spirit.  Spirits also view him as a spirit.  A Spirituality accepting Danny could targeted by the Spirit Arcana. 
Pride screwed Danny is a sucker for flattery and most manipulation.  He will most always spend willpower when opposed or challenged. 


6+	Terrible powers whose parameters are left to the Storyteller.  The powers always come with a price, the blessing is also a curse.





		




Moral Codes:
All the different moral codes used in game are based on the updated Integrity rules for the God Machine Chronicles
http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/wod2.0/CreationIntGMC.html 
Some of the universal basics are listed below

Each moral codes has a score between 10 and 0 that sits between the two extremes the moral codes represents. 
For example; Morality tracks the difference between someone who adheres to notion of being a “Good” (Strider paradigm) or morale person and someone who is “Evil” or immoral person. 10 represents the most “Good” or morale person. 1 represents someone who is “Evil” or immoral. 0 represents someone who can no longer be a PC because they are so amoral the idea of morality no longer applies
To contrast; Integrity tracks the difference between someone who has a psyche that is complete and unscarred or a person who has been mentally scarred so much their psyche is flayed to pieces. 10 represents someone who has never encountered a horrifying situation or has never been affected by it. 1 represents someone who has been driven to madness over the horrifying things they have seen. 0 represents someone who can no longer be a PC, likely because they are catatonic or raving crazy.  
Another example; Humanity tracks the difference between a former human (usually Vampire) who still understands and embodies his former humanity and a former human that has forsaken his former humanity to embody what he has become (in Vampires case this is represented by the “Beast” a part of the psyche that awakens during the Embrace to ensure the Vampire’s survival and reproduction). 10 represents a Vampire that is so in tune with humanity he is better at it than most humans. 1 represents a Vampire that given up all pretenses of embodying any aspect of his former human self. 0 represents a Vampire who could no longer be considered sentient, the Beast has fully taken over and drives all the characters motivations.   

Instead of a “hierarchy of sins” for each moral codes, each moral codes has a number of “Breaking Points”. These Breaking Points constitutes actions or events that test your characters ability to maintain that moral codes. They are unique to each moral codes, and your character’s backstory also adds a subjective layer to what constitutes a Breaking Point. An action or event may be a Breaking Point for multiple tracks of moral codes, but the difference between Breaking Points of different moralities helps tease apart the differences between the moralities. For the most part, Breaking Points never “go away”. They may evolve, requiring greater stimulus to evoke a response but the core Breaking Point doesn't change. Murdering someone is a Breaking Point for Morality. But a veteran assassin might kill enough people (and rolled to resist degeneration enough times) that ordinary contract murder doesn’t really phase her as much. The Breaking Point would then change to mass murder, or killing a child, or killing someone she wasn’t contracted to kill. The core idea of Murder is still the Breaking Point, it just takes a different flavor. 

When a character experiences a breaking point, the player rolls Resolve + Composure (diff 8) with a modifier based on the character's rating in that moral codes: 
Moral Code	Modifier 
8-10		+2	
7-6		+1
5-4		+0
3-2		-1
1		-2

The Storyteller can also impose modifiers based on how heinous the breaking point is, relative to the character's experience. The moral codes below gives some suggestions, but again, the Storyteller and the player are encouraged to develop the character's moral framework and life experience to the point that modifiers can be customized. Modifiers are cumulative, but the total modifier from circumstances should not exceed +/- 5 dice.

Resolve + Composure roll result
Dramatic Failure: The character's worldview has been damaged, perhaps beyond repair. The character suffers from traumatic stress. Lose a dot of the Moral Code. Suggested conditions: Broken, Fugue, or Madness.
Failure: The character's worldview has been shaken and he probably questions his sense of self, his ability to relate to people, his own moral worth, or his sanity. Lose a dot of Moral Code. Suggested conditions: Guilty, Shaken, or Spooked.
Success: The character has come through the breaking point intact. He might feel guilty or upset about what happened, but he can cope. Suggested Conditions: Guilty, Shaken, or Spooked.
Exceptional Success: The character somehow manages not only to survive the breaking point, but to find meaning in it, to reaffirm his own self-worth, or to pass through fire and become tempered by it. The character regains a point of Willpower.

The following descriptions also describe “Building Actions”. These are ways for your character to rebuild a damaged moral code. Again, these should be highly personalized. 

Morality
Description: Right from Wrong. Good vs. Evil. One's own personal code. 

Scale: Morale (“Good”) → Immoral (“Evil”)
10 - Saintly compassionate being
9 - Good moral person
8 - Nice person
7 - Average person
6 - Jerk
Threshold for anti-evil powers on supernatural beings of monstrous nature.
5 - Terrible person.  Cruel selfish and 
Threshold for anti-evil powers for all supernatural beings.
4 - The worst kind of person.  
3 - Loathsome, vile, cruel.  Questionable personhood. 	[Automatic ping.]
2 - 					.			[Strong ping, automatic casus belli.]
1 - 			Not a person				[Moral obligation to oppose or destroy.]
0 - Monstrous, diabolically, inhumanly evil.  While they may be sentient beings, they are so foul, selfish, twisted and alien that no safe interaction is possible with them.  Automatic casus belli to the last.  [Overwhelming evil] [Daleks, demons, eldritch horrors, diseases.]   

Questions to determine individual Breaking Points:
What is the worst thing your character has ever done? This doesn't have to be anything dastardly. If the worst thing your character ever did was steal money from his mother's purse and lie to cover it up, that's fine. What's important here is to consider something that your character did that made him hate himself.
What is the worst thing your character can imagine himself doing? We imagine ourselves in various scenarios to test our own self-image against a hypothetical situation. When children do it, it's called imaginative play, but it fills the same niche. What can you can character reasonably see himself doing, but still know that it would be wrong? Can your character imagine killing someone in self-defense? Torturing someone for information? How about robbing a store with a gun?
What is the worst thing your character can imagine someone else doing? Of course, we all know that people are capable of some hideous atrocities. What tops your character's list? Serial murder? Rape? Torture? Spree killing? If your character is extremely sheltered or misanthropic, he might have a skewed view here; he might hang on to some lofty, cerebral notion of "dishonor" or "betrayal" as the nadir of human behavior.

Integrity
Description:

Scale: Intact (“Sane”) → Broken (“Insane”)

Questions to determine individual Breaking Points:
What has the character forgotten? In Rumford, it's next to impossible to grow up without any exposure to the supernatural. Decide what your character saw and forgot. Describe this scene in as much detail as you can. This is a breaking point that has already occurred, but it helps set a benchmark for what your character would have to see in order to experience one now. If the answer is "nothing," that's fine, but it does mean that when supernatural events start to surround that character, she's assured of some breaking points.
What is the most traumatic thing that has ever happened to the character? No one goes through life with no trauma. Your character might have been mugged, beaten as a child, in a serious car accident, been kidnapped by a parent during a divorce, survived a life-threatening disease, attempted suicide, been attacked by a supernatural (or natural!) creature, or any number of other traumatic experiences. Again, the goal here isn't to make a traumatized character. It's to set a bar.

Super Science!

Hyper-Tech Research, Design and Execution 
Cost: Each roll requires that one Inspiration point be spent or the process must be temporarily halted until more Inspiration can be put into the object).  Mad science is demanding work with long hours that tax mind and will completely. When the mad scientist is engaging in super science and making the impossible they do not regain willpower from rest; for they get none. Financial costs for the R&D eat up the character's disposable income.  Reduce the character’s Resource merit by the Tech Factor for the duration of RD&E.  Additionally each piece of Tech will probably require advanced components.  These advanced components can not simply be purchased. 
Dice Pool: Intelligence + Science + Science! - The tech Factor. 
Action: Extended - successes necessary are equal to five times the tech dots desired; each roll is equal to one day’s worth of R&D. 

Roll Results
Dramatic Failure:A dramatic failure on such a roll cancels all accumulated successes and may mean
that your character must start the extended action from scratch, but also has to make some change in circumstance: he has to find a new source of information, get new tools, read the automobile repair manual or find new parts, the character destroys one of the ingredients necessary for the recipe.
Failure: No progress in research happens. 
Success: The research comes along. 
Exceptional Success: 
Suggested Modifiers: Technology demands an intricate design (–3), distractions (–2), each advanced component included in the design (–1), prototype (–1), character has Science! 6+ (+1).

These factors represent how advanced the hypertech is.  Modifiers are cumulative and cannot be reduced below 1.

The Mad scientists Science! is the limitation on creating devices which are found in science fiction.  They can not emulate a power with a higher dot value than their rank in Science!.

Cooperation:
A genius can benefit from the assistance of other people when building a wonder. Assistance can offer two benefits: it can make the work go faster, or it can add additional dice to the genius' roll to build the wonder.

Fully Qualified Geniuses and mundane scientists often contribute to the research, this is handled just like normal Teamwork: the supporting geniuses rolls, and any successes are added to the primary genius' dice roll. 
Unqualified Labor - Why am I surrounded by these fools? - A mundane scientist in the wrong field, anyone with a science skill less than 4. May be of help, however given the demands of the task they often end up distracting the mad scientist (-3). Worse while they might provided needed labor they run the risk of botching things up horribly.   An exceptional failure from such a bumbling oaf automatically worsens the results of that primary roll by a step (success ---> failure, failure ---> dramatic failure).

Time Modifiers: Fully Qualified Help (could do everything on their own) reduces the time taken for a roll by one step.  Useful Labor reduces the time by man hours.

Lab and Equipment Quality:
No Tools: +9 difficulty, roll interval increased by 2 steps (day -> month, week -> year, month -> decade, anything with a roll interval higher than that is impossible)
No Lab (basic tools and things like magnifying glasses): +6 difficulty, roll interval increased by 1 step anything with a roll interval higher than that is impossible)
Poorly Equipped Lab (your average high school science lab, a lab tech or two): +6 difficulty, doubles roll interval
Basic Lab (a handful of useful specialist tools, most general purpose tools are available, a dozen or so lab techs): +2 difficulty
Standard Lab (a broad array of relevant tools, enough lab techs exist to remove most of the grunt work): +0 difficulty
Advanced Lab (more or less every currently available tool in the lab, 50-200 or so lab techs): -1 difficulty 
Top of the Line Facility (LHC, ITER, Montressor, costs exorbitant amounts to maintain, costs even more to build): -2 difficulty, halves roll interval


Possible additional rules



Epic success- 10+ successes. 
There have been times when a character gives a legendary performance, does the seemingly impossible.  At this level of mastery the difference between the extraordinary and the supernatural blurs.  This might best be reflected by some optional, possible things that could happen.
Achieve the impossible  
Investigation or survival (tracking) could pierce illusion.
A rousing speech or personal plea could break mind control. 
Science could make progress to discovering things well beyond the current progress level.
Science and crafting technology could produce hypertech.
Act as if the character had a merit for the action. 
Gaining information
Automatic discovery of a lead or clue. 
the character finds secret doors, compartments, and any hidden goods.

 Let the player suggest what they find.  The GM can reject this, but if they do so the PC gains a willpower and the player get an automatic discovery. 
Social
Gain extra sway or opens an extra door.
Gain a favor - an expendable pseudo social merit that expires at the end of the chapter.  
Social rolls might provide insight to the targets wants, their goals or their price.

Combat 
Hurt the target just enough to apply the Beaten Down condition.
Alternatively so gain the upper hand for a follow up attack as to force them to Surrender.  


Social Maneuvering and Coercion

Goal: Determine the character's goal. If their goal is reasonable, proceed. If not the attempt automatically fails.

Shifting Goals: If the characters shifts their Goals any open Doors remain so but the number of total Doors is recalculated based on the new Goal. If the victim finds out more information about the Goal that changes their opinion it counts as a shifted Goal. 

Doors: Determine the number of Doors that stands between the character and his goal.
+1 Door for every point of (lower of Resolve/Composure)
+2 Doors if the goal constitutes a breaking point for the victim
+1 Door if the goal prevents a victim from resolving an Aspiration
+1 Door if the goal opposes the victim's Virtue

Impression: The Storytellers determines the first impression the victim has of the character. This is due to all kinds of RP variables. The impression determines how frequently the character may roll to open Doors. 
Perfect (1 roll/turn)
Excellent (1 roll/hour) 
Good (1 roll/day)
Average (1 roll/week)
Hostile (Can only do Force rolls, not Maneuvering)
A victims impression can be increased. The character must learn about their victim, perform an action that would make the victim have a better impression. This always requires a roll.
Leveraging a person's Vice to tempt them can move the character up one level of Impression if the victim gains Willpower from it. 
Gifts, bribes and promises of service can increase the Impression by a step. This usually requires the equivalent of a Merit for the duration of the agreement. 

Maneuvering Doors Open: At each interval determined by the limitations of Impression the character can roll as part of an interaction with the victim. Success opens one Door. Failure imposes a cumulative -1 on further rolls. On a failed roll Storytellers can choose to worsen the Impression by a level and gives the character a Beat. 
If the character convinces the victim he will help fulfill a victim's Aspiration a door is opened. The character doesn't need to follow through but must convince the victim of his sincerity and capability. If the character has an opportunity to advance the victim's Aspiration and backs down two Doors close. 
Maneuvering Autofail: Maneuvering can automatically fail three ways
The character rolls a dramatic failure on an attempt to open a Door (and receives a Beat)
The victim realizes he is being lied to or manipulation. Doesn't count if he was aware from the start that the character was trying to talk him into something, only if the victim feels betrayed or conned.
The Impression level reaches "Hostile" and remains so for a week in game. The character can try again next story.

Forcing Doors Open: The character states their Goal and immediately rolls. The current number of Doors is a penalty to the roll. If successful the character makes the victim go along with the goal. If the character fails the victim is immune to further attempts to manipulate or coerce them. 
The character can also employ threats, drugging, intimidation, blackmail, kidnapping and other illegal coercion. However to gain a benefit the character must suffer a breaking point due to the action. If the breaking point roll has a penalty of 0 to -2 the action opens one Door. If the breaking point roll has a penalty of -3 or greater the action opens two Doors. 

Influencing Groups: When influencing groups use the highest Resolve/Composure of any member of the group. The group also is assigned three Aspirations and overall Virtue and Vice and relative Moral Code scores. Some individuals may leave rather than go along with the consensus, but the majority will go with the flow.

Successive Manipulations: Each successful Maneuvering removes one starting Door for subsequent attempts to manipulate the victim. 
A failure to Maneuver a victim or if Forcing the Door was used the victim adds two Doors to subsequent attempts.
These bonuses/penalties are cumulative. No matter what, a victim always has one Door.


Shared Narrative Control Rules

Montage Roundtable 

The players will help decide what obstacles they face, and what they must do to overcome them.
Pick a player to start with, then go around the table. Each player will describe an exciting problem the group encounters. The next player will describe how their character solves the problem in a cinematic fashion. The GM narrates the solution back to the group, with the character as the hero, and has the hero find a cypher in the process. The player then comes up with a new problem and the next player in turn comes up with the solution. Keep going until every player has created and solved a problem.

It is known


Give them the NPC and say, tell me about ________. They tell me something. I say “It is known” and write it down. 


EXAMPLE: As a hook, I had Opal’s sister Sapphire get captured by devil cultists and thrown into the gates of hell. Opal is a PC, Sapphire is an NPC I just made up. The woman playing Opal was excited by this idea, but we didn’t know anything about Sapphire.

So I asked each player, “Tell me about Sapphire, what do you know?” Opal should know her sister — for the others, I said “You’ve been traveling with Opal for quite some time. She’s told you stories about her sister, what stuck in your mind?”

Player: “She has Blue Hair.” GM: “It is known.”

Player: “She has a penchant for losing things, even things she’s not touching. Things near her just go missing.” GM: “It is known.”

Player: “She’s a cliff diver. The cliffs in her hometown have low gravity, so she can do lots of tricks on the way down.” GM: “It is known.”

Player: “Her eyes match her hair.” GM: “It is known.”

Player: “She can alter reality with her thoughts. Only little things. A door is slightly to the right of where it was before. The blue fork is now red.” GM: “It is known.”

IF there is something problematic of something that I want to leave a possible mystery I will say -
So you have heard.







So I did a bunch of research to find the Maximum range of a lacrosse throw.

Maximum range of a lacrosse throw.  The longest lacrosse throw on record is 397^ feet or 133 feet. This would be the range for someone with a dice pool of at least 12 

How ever that is maximum range for record keeping.  The maximum range for an accurate throw seems to be 70 yards.  120 seems to be max range with a lacrosse ball. 


A lacrosse ball Weight is     140 g – 147 g

12 fl OZ is 	340 grams	20 oz is 1.25 lb or 566.9905 g

So being very generous you could throw a full bottle it say a third of the normal distance, 120 feet max range.
