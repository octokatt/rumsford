## Stunts:
* Negging: You may charm someone with Provoke if you have a victim, whether a theory or another theorist
* Favorite Asshole: You may use Provoke instead of Contacts if you have previously ruined something near them, but not them
* Bullshit Artist: You may use Science in place of Deceit if the topic is sufficiently complex.  Others may defend against this with Science or another suitable skill (Fabrication, Invention, etc.)
* I've Read Something About This: Replace another skill with Science after using a Fate Point and justification
* Fucking Terrible Generalist: Twice per session, take a boost to a Science roll -- you may never take a true specialization
* From the Shoulders of Giants (Blantant Plagerism): If you have exposure to someone elseâ€™s work on a subject, either through a tag or through use of Security, get a +1 to Science rolls on the subject, and complete your research one time increment faster
* Friday Protocol (War-crime AI Assistant): You always have a computer interface, and can accomplish Science or Computer-based tasks one time interval faster.  Spend a Space Point to interact at a time interval equal to AI Speed I.  Afterwards, take physical damage equal to your highest check result (you do not get a defense roll).

### Levels of Dead:

LEVEL | DESCRIPTION
------|-------------
LAZ 1 | Killed from wound that doesn't destroy the brain; savable by medics
LAZ 2 | Killed by brain injury, but distributed neural back-ups are still viable; savable by facility, full recovery
LAZ 3 | Brain is destroyed and distributed neural back-ups are damaged, but within tolerances; savable by specialized facility, with short-term memory loss
LAZ 4 | Brain is destroyed and body back-ups are destroyed; a person suffering a LAZ 4 death may experience some personality differences
LAZ 5 | Entire body is destroyed; a clone may be created with backed-up, off-site memories and a clone, but everything before the back-up is gone
LAZ 6 | Entire body is destroyed and memory back-ups are damaged; a person suffering a LAZ 6 death may have memory loss, personality changes, and physical changes
LAZ 7 | Entire body is destroyed and back-ups are destroyed; a sufficiently well-trained AI may be able to put together a version of a duplicate, but they will inevitably have personality flaws, physical changes, and will need long-term therapies to prevent disassociation
LAZ 8 | Individual is removed from the timeline; they have never existed
