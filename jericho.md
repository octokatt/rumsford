* Favorite Asshole: You may use Provoke instead of Contacts if you have previously ruined something near them, but not them
* Bullshit Artist: You may use Science in place of Deceit if the topic is sufficiently complex.  Others may defend against this with Science or another suitable skill (Fabrication, Invention, etc.)
* I've Read Something About This: Replace another skill with Science after using a Fate Point and justification
* Fucking Terrible Generalist: Twice per session, take a boost to a Science roll -- you may never take a true specialization
* From the Shoulders of Giants: If you have exposure to someone elseâ€™s work on a subject, either through a tag or through use of Security, get a +1 to Science rolls on the subject, and complete your research one time increment faster
