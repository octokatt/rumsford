## Stunts:
* Negging: You may charm someone with Provoke if you have a victim, whether a theory or another theorist
* Favorite Asshole: You may use Provoke instead of Contacts if you have previously ruined something near them, but not them
* Bullshit Artist: You may use Science in place of Deceit if the topic is sufficiently complex.  Others may defend against this with Science or another suitable skill (Fabrication, Invention, etc.)
* I've Read Something About This: Replace another skill with Science after using a Fate Point and justification
* Fucking Terrible Generalist: Twice per session, take a boost to a Science roll -- you may never take a true specialization
* From the Shoulders of Giants: If you have exposure to someone elseâ€™s work on a subject, either through a tag or through use of Security, get a +1 to Science rolls on the subject, and complete your research one time increment faster
* Friday Protocol (War-crime AI Assistant): You always have a computer interface, and can accomplish Science or Computer-based tasks one time interval faster.  Spend a Space Point to interact at a time interval equal to AI Speed I.  Afterwards, take physical damage equal to your highest check result (you do not get a defense roll).
