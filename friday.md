## Stunts:
* Goddamn AI: While you may not roll social without a penalty unless you have another stunt enabling you to do so, in terms of sheer logic power, you act incredibly fast.  In a race against normal fleshies, you win.  (AI Speed I)
* Well-Read Social Skills: During play age, you were given communication logs of socially compentent people.  You may roll Deceive and Empathy normally.
* From the Shoulders of Giants (Blantant Plagerism): Jericho is a terrible influence.  If you can work with someone else, get a +1 to Science rolls on the subject, and complete your research one time increment faster.


##### Total Refresh:   4

## Notes:

* Born from a Darwinian contest to avoid Jericho's notice

* Looking forward to working with anyone else for something novel
* Cy-human versus Bio-human
