### _Crazy Timeline Shenanigans with Strider of the Amber_


* * * * * 

## 2018-11-21

### Last Time (OOC)
* Baby primordial was slumming but wanted special blood
	- Timothy broke in and got the goooood blood
* Confirmed the blood bank is where vampires go to get blood, probably other blood drinkers
* Party interacted with their family, things happened 
    - Melville realized his parents were talking about peasants, Stacy didn't disappear
    - Ryker's parents were disappointed
    - Melville confirmed his lady has some issues


### This Session (IC, Manyara)
* Manyara has been figuring out (a) how to get a license, (b) how power systems and government works here, (c) where nodes and spirits are.
    - Graveyard is a peaceful place but larger node
    - Sunless Woods is a spooky, abandoned Christmas Tree farm which should be popular, but everyone avoids it
    - Subtle spiritual presense all around the school, it fits in its environment, but its not disruptive and makes sense... It's a spirit of Intellect, and the Math teacher and a few others have attuned themselves to it
    - No cults in the school
    - The private school south of the Grove has something going on, not quite wrong, but a Something
* Shortcuts through town with Danny which go from end to end
    - Resonance sub-map on the Google Maps shows where the shortcuts are

### This Session (IC, Ila)
* This place is one, giant goddamn rift.  It's not a tear, reality has been worn through.  The Place on the Hill is the worst.
* Others in town let me find cheap land.
* A giant forest fire happened near the Rift.  It was contained, but all the houses in the area were lost.  No one died.
* Mr. D. recruited people to deal with the Verge, refused pay, joined the Cool Kids Mage Group
    - The other person who didn't want any money was an old guy herbalist who lives in the woods, litle naive.
    - There was a grand realignment to ursurp the "Mandate of Heaven, then thieves broke in and took the plans, shared them with this group, and then things unfolded
    - Six places were affected (all hills) to create a pentagon (with a central location where the Verge lies) which focused the ritual.
* Observed fae just randomly grabbing people.  Crew behaved admirably.
    - Danny attempted to take the aggro.  Kudos to that one.

* * * * *

## 2018-12-05

### Ila's IC Notes:
* Met Danny, Timothy, Melville at the Chinese Food Shop, discussed the Shadowcritter issue -- plans were made
    - Plans made to check on veteran with Danny
    - Tried to help Timothy, Melville with a "daring raid"... but failed


* * * * * 

## 2018-12-12

### Ila's IC Notes:
* Observing the Veteran:
    - "Charlie's Spot"
    - He's disconnected, not really involved
    - The dark threads strangling him are small and muted, this is a slow burn effect
* Danny has a flaming eagle as a familiar, left to him by his father

### OOC Notes:
* Incan Staff of Priviledge
* Timothy and Melville had an adventure and a car chase


* * * * *

## 2018-12-19

### Ila's IC Notes:
* Ila got an earpiece, and met ERIC
* Timothy picked up a Supernal artifact
* Andros Iker is Timothy's father
    - We met, went well, he is the more permissive parent who will lend grenades, Timothy's mother does care and will ground Timothy
    - Established what level house protections were at, then found where improvements needed to occur


* * * * * 

## 2018-12-26

### Ila's IC Notes:

* Dog with green eyes that circles exactly twice
* Family came back to town
* Went to the Library
    - Wards notes:
        + Art Noveau, protect from casual destruction -- seen in cast iron
        + Next layer, protect from Cthulu
        + 1930's, brutalist approach when The Man came to town, most likely when this place was updated for nukes, and added to existing wards
            * In case of reality failure, this place will remain
    - Equivilent to 4-dot Library merit
    - Parts of Library:
        + Government records from colonial era
        + Card catalogue
        + This is a library created by upper-crust occultists, colonialists
        + Metal plates have inscriptions to remember things
    - This is a Solid and Real place (via Prime)
        + If something would call on the Supernal or cause Paradox, it would become lessened as a result of this place

* * * * * 

## 2019-01-30

### Ila's OOC Notes:

* Danny shot Timothy, and is a dumbass
* Timothy got shot, and now his dad is *pissed*
* Somehow, this is my problem

### Other thing:
* Bad Guy HR is named Rachel
* Bad Guys split into two factions, and the Ursurper vs. Maintainer created a nightmare


* * * * * 

## 2019-02-06

### Ila's IC Notes:
* Emme said the town has never been this bad, there were six rituals here
    - Exact details are unknown
    - Everyone who participated is gone, and others simply fled
    - Worse, it went horribly wrong
    - Witnesses don't matter to Paradox; worse, no one understands the supernatural is supernatural, they accept things are real
    - First Consilium is now started
* Danny... tried to apologize
    - He is a murderer, and isn't sorry
    - We can have a working relationship
* Lord Iker turned up at Ila's house
    - Made a deal with Odo for a Timothy Rez Potion
    - Ila tried to take the check, and it might work
    - Lots of arguing with Lucky, Gita, and Randal
    - Randal is smart, and did what Ila goddamn told him to do
    - Van and gear got cleaned, blood samples in hand


* * * * *

## 2019-02-13

### Ila's IC Notes
* Consilium finally happened with Emme, Momma R, Dwayne, and Ila
* Timothy was at the Winter Solstice ritual
    - AFP: America First Partnership, were eaten by Nazis
    - Danny, of course, lit things on fire
    - An undead dragon, an avatar of the Nydhagg-nagar, the wyrm that devours from beneath, which upon finishing eating the roots will cause Ragnarok
* The Nee'ogi created Stacylacrum
    - A dealmaker, an evil dealmaker
    - Ila gains one flyer
* Why Stacylacrum happened
    - A friend of Melville's was being tortured, and this friend saw he was trying to become more of a hero, and as a result she wanted his help and started training him
    - When his training was complete, he was challenged to a duel which ended badly as she continued to fight while badly injured
        + And then Timothy and Melville
* ERIC will go on a murder spree if any of the Solstice Knights or any of the Neverborn/Paradox-borne
    - The paradox-borne have hopes, souls, and dreams
* Ila gets the Artifact

    - The words are True
    - This has the Mantle of Truth
