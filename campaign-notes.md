### Last Time (OOC)
* Baby primordial was slumming but wanted special blood
	- Timothy broke in and got the goooood blood
* Confirmed the blood bank is where vampires go to get blood, probably other blood drinkers
* Party interacted with their family, things happened 
    - Melville realized his parents were talking about peasants, Stacy didn't disappear
    - Ryker's parents were disappointed
    - Melville confirmed his lady has some issues


### This Session (IC, Manyara)
* Manyara has been figuring out (a) how to get a license, (b) how power systems and government works here, (c) where nodes and spirits are.
    - Graveyard is a peaceful place but larger node
    - Sunless Woods is a spooky, abandoned Christmas Tree farm which should be popular, but everyone avoids it
    - Subtle spiritual presense all around the school, it fits in its environment, but its not disruptive and makes sense... It's a spirit of Intellect, and the Math teacher and a few others have attuned themselves to it
    - No cults in the school
    - The private school south of the Grove has something going on, not quite wrong, but a Something
* Shortcuts through town with Danny which go from end to end
    - Resonance sub-map on the Google Maps shows where the shortcuts are

### This Session (IC, Ila)
* This place is one, giant goddamn rift.  It's not a tear, reality has been worn through.  The Place on the Hill is the worst.
* Others in town let me find cheap land.
* A giant forest fire happened near the Rift.  It was contained, but all the houses in the area were lost.  No one died.
* Mr. D. recruited people to deal with the Verge, refused pay, joined the Cool Kids Mage Group
    - The other person who didn't want any money was an old guy herbalist who lives in the woods, litle naive.
    - There was a grand realignment to ursurp the "Mandate of Heaven, then thieves broke in and took the plans, shared them with this group, and then things unfolded
    - Six places were affected (all hills) to create a pentagon (with a central location where the Verge lies) which focused the ritual.
* Observed fae just randomly grabbing people.  Crew behaved admirably.
    - Danny attempted to take the aggro.  Kudos to that one.

### Ila's IC Notes:
* Observing the Veteran:
    - "Charlie's Spot"
    - He's disconnected, not really involved
    - The dark threads strangling him are small and muted, this is a slow burn effect
* Danny has a flaming eagle as a familiar, left to him by his father

### OOC Notes:
* Incan Staff of Priviledge
* Timothy and Melville had an adventure and a car chase
