## Merits and Advantages

#### Knowing Stuff

(2) Danger Sense: You can a +2 on Wits+Composure rolls to detect an ambush; this is due to a nearly paranoid level of wards use [Paranoia] <WoD Core, pg. 108>
(2) Eidetic Memory: You have a near photographic memory; you do not need to roll to remember things, and during stressful conditions you have a +2 modifier on any Intelligence+Composure to remember something, or any other Skill-based roll to remember something.  <WoD Core, pg. 108>
(2) Languages: Dutch, Bengali
(2) Multilingual: Sanskrit, Latin, Old Norse, Hindi. <Reliquary, pg. 85>


#### Doing Stuff

(3) Crafter's Sense: You have an intuitive knack for your specialty.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Crafts to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 131>
(1) Good Time Management: Years of working with demanding overmasters have served you well.  Each roll in an extended _mundane_ action has the time requirement reduced by 25%.  <Asylum, pg. 50>
(1) Make Do (Crafts): Reduce all penalties from inappropriate tools by the rating of this merit. [Paranoia] <The Free Council, pg. 132>
(3) Scientist's Sense (Geomancy): You have an intuitive sense of your scientific discipline, borne of experience.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Crafts to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 133>
(2) Professional Training, Ward-Master:
* Networking: Contacts (2)
* Continuing Education: Occult, Crafts, Science



## Flaws, Associations

(*) Disabled, Congenital Muscular Dystrophy: You are physically disabled; while you can hobble for short distances while wearing braces (1m/turn), your primary mode of transportation is by wheelchair.  For all the jokes about better parking and VIP treatment, this is a major hindrance to your life and may cause people to take you less seriously.  However, when attempting to use your disabled status to gain a social advantage, treat this Flaw as Striking Looks (4).
(*) Status, Community College: Adjunct Professor
(*) Emiama/"Emme", the Ancient Witch [from Professional Training]
(*) Momma R, the Helpful Witch [from Professional Training]
(*) Academic (Wizard) Contacts [from Professional Training]
(*) "Helpful" Family: One parent doesn't care if she awakens, as long as she gets a good job, a husband, and grandkids.  The other doesn't care about that, as long as she Awakens.
    - British Raj Architects
(*) Dartmouth Student (commuter)
(*) Geoffrey Ash: Family Rivalry, must prove that he's the sad, sad Crowley-wanna be that he is, bugger him
(*) Melissa Andrus: Miserable architect that's a local family connection, who is now almost-always miserable due to a bad project.
(*) Silver Ladder: You are associated with the Silver Ladder.  Geoffrey is a _terrible_ Silver Ladder.

(*) Family Connections: You can find the right person for the job.  Treat all services as costing one Resource dot less.  This may require you to "occasionally" perform services for less than your usual fee in return.


## Backgrounds

(4) Local Union #348, Dwarven Construction: You are on good terms with the local dwarven union, and contribute regularly to their projects.  As a result, you gain a number of useful benefits.
(2) Resources: You have material resources, worth $1,000 per month of disposable income and $5,000 worth of assets.

## Possessions

* Wheelchair Drive Van: you have a van which can be driven from a wheelchair.  Other people can attempt to drive your van, but they are at a penalty if they have never used this type of vehicle before
* Good Computer Equipment

## Unique Qualities


### Astral Journeying

(5) Vision: Your character has Vision, and is capable of visualizing plans with great clarity and using this visualization to guide her work.  This has multiple effects:
  * When spending Willpower, you may use your Vision to assist yourself on any extended action, and roll Vision + an appropriate Skill, and each success is added as bonus dice to the next roll on the extended action.
  * You may substitute your dots in Vision for an Attribute or Skill when rolling to assist another character on an extended action.  The Storyteller has the final say on whether a given trait can be replaced.
(3) Astral Adept: Your character is deeply in tune with her own soul, and may enter the Astral Realms without a place of power. In addition to the access methods listed on p. 249, your character may perform a ceremony to attune herself to the astral, then spend a Willpower point to allow her to meditate into the realms. Decide what form your ceremony takes when buying this Merit; many mages use a Legacy Oblation, while Sleepwalkers might require special drugs, exercises, or chants.
(4) Meditative Mind:  You're good at meditating!


### Geomancy

#### Geomancer

(1) The character can make an extended action Intelligence + Occult roll to figure out what has affected the ley energies. The target number depends on the size of the area, and how far back the character wants to trace the geomantic changes. Atlantean-era sites lie in the distant past, and the local net of ley lines may have undergone dozens or even hundreds of changes. 

In such cases, 20 or more successes might be required to map the effects of time — even considering that powerful mystic sites tend to bend the local energies and attract ley lines through all the changes. The time per roll is one day, during which the character studies the area and contemplates how geomantic principles might apply. 

Possible tool modifiers include classic geomancy manuals (+1 or +2, depending on quality), dowsing rods (+1) and even satellite imagery (+2).

Dramatic Failure: The character completely misunderstands the meaning and portent of certain features of the area. If exploration proceeds along these lines, the investigators find themselves in some dire predicament (clinging 
to cliffs, exploring unstable caves, trespassing upon military bases, etc.).

Failure: The character fails to grasp how the area’s ley landscape has altered.

Success: The character has a timeline for how the shape and/or fl ow of ley lines in the area have changed.

Exceptional Success: The character’s knowledge is so precise that other effects are possible, such as uncovering possible nodes or revealing the logic behind the initial network of ley lines.


#### Use Geomancy

* Dice Pool: Intelligence + Crafts
* Minimum Successes Required:
    - 5 (small room)
    - 10 (typical home)
    - 15 (typical offi ce)
    - 20 (multi-story building)
    - 25 or more (skyscraper, Disneyland Hong Kong, Love Canal)
* Ritual Length: One hour per five successes needed.  Actual construction or redesign certainly takes longer — days or weeks depending on the size of the project.
* Duration: Indefinite (until disrupted)

* Roll Results:
    - Success: Once per scene, the first person to attempt an appropriate action within the space gains the 9 again effect (reroll 9s and 10s) for that single roll. Large spaces have the potential to help more people, one per distinct area of the space. (Note that this effect does not affect a chance die, should a dice pool be reduced to one. Only a result of 10 is a success under those circumstances.)
    Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the fl ow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. 
    New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place
    - Exceptional Success: The flow of energy grants the 9-again bonus to the first two related rolls per scene.
    - Dramatic Failure: The geomantic design is flawed, but the thaumaturge doesn’t notice. When the plan is implemented, the Storyteller might have it disrupt nearby geomantic effects or have some disaster strike during construction or redecorating that is clearly the geomancer’s fault.
    
* Suggested Equipment: Religious holy site or magical nexus (+1 to +3 provided the structure is appropriate)
* Possible Penalties: Multiple geomantic spaces within the same physical structure (–1 for each), site is haunted (–1), negative history (–1 for a murder or failed business to –5 for a toxic waste dump or death camp), shoddy materials (–1 to –3), dense urban area (–3), modern industrial area (–2), town 
or suburb (–1), holy site used inappropriately (–1 to –5)
