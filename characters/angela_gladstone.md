Merits and Advantages
============

(3) Crafter's Sense: You have an intuitive knack for your specialty.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Crafts to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 131>
(2) Danger Sense: You can a +2 on Wits+Composure rolls to detect an ambush; this is due to a nearly paranoid level of wards use [Paranoia] <WoD Core, pg. 108>
(2) Eidetic Memory: You have a near photographic memory; you do not need to roll to remember things, and during stressful conditions you have a +2 modifier on any Intelligence+Composure to remember something, or any other Skill-based roll to remember something.  <WoD Core, pg. 108>
(1) Good Time Management: Years of working with demanding overmasters have served you well.  Each roll in an extended _mundane_ action has the time requirement reduced by 25%.  <Asylum, pg. 50>
(2) Multilingual: Dutch, Bengali, Sanskrit, Hindi. <Reliquary, pg. 85>
(3) Make Do (Crafts): Reduce all penalties from inappropriate tools by the rating of this merit. [Paranoia] <The Free Council, pg. 132>
(3) Scientist's Sense (Geomancy): You have an intuitive sense of your scientific discipline, borne of experience.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Crafts to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 133>

(2) Resources: You have material resources, worth $1,000 per month of disposable income and $5,000 worth of assets.



Flaws, Backgrounds and Associations
=============

(*) Disabled, Inherited: You are physically disabled; while you can hobble for short distances (1m/turn), your primary mode of transportation is by wheelchair.  For all the jokes about better parking and VIP treatment, this is a major hindrance to your life and may cause people to take you less seriously.  When attempting to use your disabled status to gain a social advantage, treat this Flaw as Striking Looks (4).
(2) Status, Community College: Adjunct Professor
(3) Occultation:  You hide your resonance.  <MtA core, pg. 86>
(*) Emiama/"Emme", the Ancient Witch
(*) Momma R
(*) "Helpful" Family: One parent doesn't care if she awakens, as long as she gets a good job, a husband, and grandkids.  The other doesn't care about that, as long as she awakens.
    - British Raj Architects
(*) Dartmouth Student (commuter)
(*) Geoffrey Ash: Family Rivalry, must prove that he's the sad, sad Crowley-wanna be that he is, bugger him
(*) Melissa Andrus: Miserable architect that's a local family connection, who is now almost-always miserable





Unique Qualities
=============

(5) Vision: Your character has Vision, and is capable of visualizing plans with great clarity and using this visualization to guide her work.  This has multiple effects:
  * When spending Willpower, you may use your Vision to assist yourself on any extended action, and roll Vision + an appropriate Skill, and each success is added as bonus dice to the next roll on the extended action.
  * You may substitute your dots in Vision for an Attribute or Skill when rolling to assist another character on an extended action.  The Storyteller has the final say on whether a given trait can be replaced.
(5) Anti-Psi:  Anti-Psi is a rare ability, the existence of which has only recently been theorized by parapsychologists. A person gifted with Anti-Psi (who can never be an active psychic) has the power to greatly inhibit psychic powers by her mere presence. Any individual who strongly disbelieves in psychic phenomena can impose a –1 or –2 penalty on a psychic’s abilities (see Doubting Thomas, below), but an Anti-Psi goes even further, literally jamming a psychic’s ability to function at all. Any psychic in the presence of an Anti-Psi is automatically reduced to a chance die on any attempts to use psychic powers. A person with this Merit likely has no idea that she has any special abilities, and simply ascribes any failure of psychics to perform in her presence as proof of the fraudulent nature of such phenomena. <Second Sight, pg. 64> [paranoia]
(3) Psychic Resistance:  Your character, through extensive training, has an innate resistance to invasive telepathic powers.  You may roll Wits+Compusure reflexively to detect a psychic power being used on yourself, and the rating of this merit is added to your Resolve or Composure when rolling to context any psychic powers affecting your mind.  [paranoia]
