Ila\n\n_\"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\"_\n_\"Industry isn't a newspaper column, it's a Virtue -- one of the few that always matters\"_\n\n### Description\n\n_Pale skin with white-blond hair marks a contrast to traditionally Bengali features, which is further accented by traditional Bengali dress (bindi, long tunic dress, loose pants, long neck scarf).  Long, thin limbs give a strange contrast to the loose flowing clothing.  Pale eyes constantly search her environment for a new feature, but when engaged her gaze never changes._\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n### Aspects\n\n##### Nature: Pedagogue\n\n##### Virtue: Craftsmanship/Industry\n##### Vice: Paranoia\n\n##### High Concept: Structural Improvements Thaumaturge\n##### Trouble: Competent Professional\n##### _Bonus Trouble:_ Family Means Well\n\n#### Integrity: 6\n\n###### Mana Pool: 3 / 5\n###### WillPower: 6 / 9\n\n\n### Aspirations\n* Get caught by someone with a powerful Fate\n* Go to some kind of social gathering, probably at Sozo's\n* Study the geomancy of Rumsford\n\n\n### Name Meanings\n\n* Angela, _English_, God's Messenger\n* Mukta, _Sanskrit_, Free\n* Bodhi, _Sanskrit_, Awakened\n* Cruyssen, _Dutch_, Crossroads\n* Gladstone, _English_, Bright Rock\n* Ila, _Hindi_, Earth/Speech\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n## Attributes\n\n| MENTAL\t| PHYSICAL\t| SOCIAL\t|\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| INT 5\t\t| STR 1\t\t| PRE 2     |\n| WIT 3     | DEX 1     | MAN 3     |\n| RES 5     | STA 1     | COM 4     |\n\n\n\n## Skills\n\n| MENTAL        | PHYSICAL      | SOCIAL        |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Academics   1 | Athletics     | Animal Ken    |\n| Computer    2 | Brawl         | Empathy       |\n| Crafts*     3 | Drive       2 | Expression  3 |\n| Investigate   | Larceny     2 | Intimidate  1 |\n| Occult*     4 | Firearms      | Persuation* 2 |\n| Medicine    1 | Stealth       | Socialize   2 |\n| Politics      | Survival      | Streetwise    |\n| Science*    4 | Weaponry      | Subterfuge  2 |\n\n\n#### Specialties\n\n* Persuation (Sympathy; see *Disabled*)\n* Science (Physics)(Geometry)(Geomancy, Interdisciplinary Specialty) [9-again]\n* Crafts (Wards 2, Interdisciplinary Specialty) [9-again]\n* Occult [9-again]\n* Intimidate (Spirits; see Flaw: Warded)\n* Expression (poetry/mudra recitation)\n* Drive (Van)\n\n\n#### Informed Conditions\n\n* Baby Godfather... fucking shit, Thads\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n\n## Merits and Advantages\n\n### Knowlege-based\n\n(2) Danger Sense: You can a +2 on Wits+Composure rolls to detect an ambush; this is due to a nearly paranoid level of wards use [Paranoia] <WoD Core, pg. 108>\n\n(2) Eidetic Memory: You have a near photographic memory; you do not need to roll to remember things, and during stressful conditions you have a +2 modifier on any Intelligence+Composure to remember something, or any other Skill-based roll to remember something.  <WoD Core, pg. 108>\n\n(3) Languages: Dutch, Bengali, Sanskrit  <WoD Core>\n\n(2) Multilingual: Latin, Old Norse, Hindi, Tibetan, Nepali  <Reliquary, pg. 85>\n\n\n### Warding-based\n\n(3) Crafter's Sense: You have an intuitive knack for your specialty.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Crafts to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 131>\n\n(1) Good Time Management: Years of working with demanding overmasters have served you well.  Each roll in an extended _mundane_ action has the time requirement reduced by 25%.  <Asylum, pg. 50>\n\n(1) Make Do (Crafts): Reduce all penalties from inappropriate tools by the rating of this merit. [Paranoia] <The Free Council, pg. 132>\n\n(3) Scientist's Sense (Geomancy): You have an intuitive sense of your scientific discipline, borne of experience.  When creating something within your specialty, you may roll Wits+Science/Occult to know how well or how poorly you're doing, in addition to any benefits gained from the Common Sense merit.  <The Free Council, pg. 133>\n\n(1) Patient: When taking extended actions, you may roll two more times than your base dice pool\n\n(2) Professional Training, Ward-Master:\n* Networking: Contacts (2)\n* Continuing Education: Occult, Crafts, Science\n\n(2) Indomitable: Whenever someone attempts to overpower your will supernaturally, gain a +2 to the defense or roll\n\n\n### Socal-based\n\n(1) Cohesive Unit: Your character is a natural teamplayer who brings out the best from those he works with. At one dot, team members add +2 dice to teamwork actions dedicated to helping the team <CoD, pg. 72> \n\n\n### Professional Ties\n\n(*) Status, Community College: Adjunct Professor\n\n(*) Emiama/\"Emme\", the Ancient Witch [from Professional Training]\n\n(*) Momma R, the Helpful Witch [from Professional Training]\n\n(*) Academic (Wizard) Contacts [from Professional Training]\n\n(*) Dartmouth Student (commuter)\n\n(*) Geoffrey Ash: Family Rivalry, must prove that he's the sad, sad Crowley-wanna be that he is, bugger him\n\n(*) Melissa Andrus: Miserable architect that's a local family connection, who is now almost-always miserable due to a bad project.\n\n\n### Family Ties\n\n(*) Family Connections: You can find the right person for the job.  Treat all services as costing one Resource dot less.  This may require you to \"occasionally\" perform services for less than your usual fee in return.\n\n(*) \"Helpful\" Family: Angie's mother, [], wants her to be happy, which means finding a good job, getting a good husband, and having three to four children.  Gratefully, her father doesn't worry about this... as long as she awakens as a Magi.  \n\n(*) Silver Ladder: You are associated with the Silver Ladder.  Geoffrey is a _terrible_ Silver Ladder.\n\n(*) Shadow Contact, Abaddon: You can gain information about something's banes, but at a strange and often high cost.  These communications are always in Sanskrit.\n\n\n### Backgrounds\n\n(4) Local Union #348, Dwarven Construction: You are on good terms with the local dwarven union, and contribute regularly to their projects.  As a result, you gain a number of useful benefits:\n    * (1) Anyone who's hung out with dwarves for long enough has heard their remarks about craftsmanship.  Gain the Style merit.\n    * (2) You've started taking on Dwarven Stoicism.  Add one dot of Closed Book to your character sheet; this may not increase your score over five.\n    * (3) Dwarves invite you to drinking parties.  Choose two of Strong Back, Iron Stomach, Natural Immunity, or Quick Draw.  You are now an Honorary Dwarf, or at least a Dwarf-friend, depending on the relationship.\n    * (4) Dwarves invite you to _work crews_, which is a distinct honor.  You gain the benefits of Fixer when related to things solvable by dwarves, and Contacts (Dwarves).  \n    * (5) You have proven your worth enough to be granted access to the famed Dwarven Mines.  Gain three points of Resources or one Artifact.\n\n(2) Resources: You have material resources, worth $1,000 per month of disposable income and $5,000 worth of assets.\n\n\n### Flaws\n\n(*) Disabled, Congenital Muscular Dystrophy: You are physically disabled; while you can hobble for short distances while wearing braces (1m/turn), your primary mode of transportation is by wheelchair.  For all the jokes about better parking and VIP treatment, this is a major hindrance to your life and may cause people to take you less seriously.  However, when attempting to use your disabled status to gain a social advantage, treat this Flaw as Striking Looks (4).\n\n(*) Well-warded To Spirits: Gain a +1 to Intimidate against spirits, and to attempts to abjure or exorcise them from places or human hosts.  Take a -2 to any attempts to interact positively with spirits.  This gets significantly worse when using Geomancy, Wards, or Exorcism.\n\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n## Possessions\n\n* Wheelchair Drive Van: you have a van which can be driven from a wheelchair.  Other people can attempt to drive your van, but they are at a penalty if they have never used this type of vehicle before\n* Good Computer Equipment\n* _Enchanted Ring_: One of your favorite aunts passed down a _Ring of Mage Hand_, to assist you with your studies.  This is helpful for holding books.  This is unhelpful for producing paradox.  \n\n\n### Background Notes\n\n* From Bengali city of Kolkata, with family in Patna to the North\n    - Family is made up of traditional Bengali, Dutch-Indian, and British\n    - Due to a well-meaning protection placed on the family during the British Raj period, throwbacks to blonde-hair and blue-eyes happen in an attempt to ensure someone is always able to present to foreigners\n* Upon the increase of hostilities between Pakistan and India, was to the United States to complete college\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n## Unique Qualities\n\n\n### Astral Journeying\n\n(5) Vision: Your character has Vision, and is capable of visualizing plans with great clarity and using this visualization to guide her work.  This has multiple effects:\n  * When spending Willpower, you may use your Vision to assist yourself on any extended action, and roll Vision + an appropriate Skill, and each success is added as bonus dice to the next roll on the extended action.\n  * You may substitute your dots in Vision for an Attribute or Skill when rolling to assist another character on an extended action.  The Storyteller has the final say on whether a given trait can be replaced.\n\n(3) Astral Adept: Your character is deeply in tune with her own soul, and may enter the Astral Realms without a place of power. In addition to the access methods listed on p. 249, your character may perform a ceremony to attune herself to the astral, then spend a Willpower point to allow her to meditate into the realms. Decide what form your ceremony takes when buying this Merit; many mages use a Legacy Oblation, while Sleepwalkers might require special drugs, exercises, or chants.\n\n(4) Meditative Mind:  You're good at meditating!\n* Ignore environmental and wound penalties on meditation rolls. \n* Meditation grants +3 to Resolve + Composure rolls for the remainder of the day. \n* Meditation rolls only need to accumulate one success\n\n\n### Geomancy\n\n#### Geomancer\n\n(1) The character can make an extended action Intelligence + Occult roll to figure out what has affected the ley energies. The target number depends on the size of the area, and how far back the character wants to trace the geomantic changes. Atlantean-era sites lie in the distant past, and the local net of ley lines may have undergone dozens or even hundreds of changes. \n\nIn such cases, 20 or more successes might be required to map the effects of time — even considering that powerful mystic sites tend to bend the local energies and attract ley lines through all the changes. The time per roll is one day, during which the character studies the area and contemplates how geomantic principles might apply. \n\nPossible tool modifiers include classic geomancy manuals (+1 or +2, depending on quality), dowsing rods (+1) and even satellite imagery (+2).\n\nDramatic Failure: The character completely misunderstands the meaning and portent of certain features of the area. If exploration proceeds along these lines, the investigators find themselves in some dire predicament (clinging \nto cliffs, exploring unstable caves, trespassing upon military bases, etc.).\n\nFailure: The character fails to grasp how the area’s ley landscape has altered.\n\nSuccess: The character has a timeline for how the shape and/or fl ow of ley lines in the area have changed.\n\nExceptional Success: The character’s knowledge is so precise that other effects are possible, such as uncovering possible nodes or revealing the logic behind the initial network of ley lines.\n\n\n#### Use Geomancy\n\n* Dice Pool: Intelligence + Crafts\n* Minimum Successes Required:\n    - 5 (small room)\n    - 10 (typical home)\n    - 15 (typical offi ce)\n    - 20 (multi-story building)\n    - 25 or more (skyscraper, Disneyland Hong Kong, Love Canal)\n* Ritual Length: One hour per five successes needed.  Actual construction or redesign certainly takes longer — days or weeks depending on the size of the project.\n* Duration: Indefinite (until disrupted)\n\n* Roll Results:\n    - Success: Once per scene, the first person to attempt an appropriate action within the space gains the 9 again effect (reroll 9s and 10s) for that single roll. Large spaces have the potential to help more people, one per distinct area of the space. (Note that this effect does not affect a chance die, should a dice pool be reduced to one. Only a result of 10 is a success under those circumstances.)\n    Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the fl ow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. \n    New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place\n    - Exceptional Success: The flow of energy grants the 9-again bonus to the first two related rolls per scene.\n    - Dramatic Failure: The geomantic design is flawed, but the thaumaturge doesn’t notice. When the plan is implemented, the Storyteller might have it disrupt nearby geomantic effects or have some disaster strike during construction or redecorating that is clearly the geomancer’s fault.\n    \n* Suggested Equipment: Religious holy site or magical nexus (+1 to +3 provided the structure is appropriate)\n* Possible Penalties: Multiple geomantic spaces within the same physical structure (–1 for each), site is haunted (–1), negative history (–1 for a murder or failed business to –5 for a toxic waste dump or death camp), shoddy materials (–1 to –3), dense urban area (–3), modern industrial area (–2), town \nor suburb (–1), holy site used inappropriately (–1 to –5)\n\n\n\n### Proximi: Closed Gate Tradition\n\n_You are a part of the Ianus Clausa Proximi line._\n\n(1) Hardened Exorcist: Your character stood her ground against intruders \nfrom other realms, and despite the toll it’s taken on her soul she remains defiant. Add her Occult dots to her Integrity for determining any bonuses to abjuration rolls. You can also use your exorcist’s Vice to call upon abjurations without the usual penalty.\n\n\n##### Arete: 2\n\n###### Prime: 3\n###### Forces: 1\n###### Space: 2\n###### Abjuration: 3\n\n\n### Spell Forms\n* Mage Sight (Forces, Prime, Space, Abjuration)\n* Ward Location (Lying Maps; Space 2): You hide a location, roll  <MtA, pg. 174>\n* Trip Wire (Scrying, _Limited_; Space 2): A thin thread across a location which, when tripped, will alert you to the action.  <MtA, pg. 174>\n* Dispel Magic (Dispel Magic; Prime 1): As long as you have the same spheres as the caster, you may attempt to counter Awakened magic.  <MtA, pg. 165>\n* Sacred Tools (As Above, So Below; Prime 2): Your tools are sacred and enchanted, giving you 9-again on spellcasting rolls.  <MtA, pg. 167>\n* Bind Charm (Ephemeral Enchantment; Prime 3): An item is bound so tightly the object can affect things in Twilight.  <MtA, pg. 169>\n* Geomantic Change (Geomancy; Prime 3): You can reshape Nodes and change Resonance.  <MtA, pg. 169>\n* Ward Purpose (Platonic Form; Prime 3): Enchant an item to be more useful.  <MtA, pg. 169>\n* Create Ward (Create Ward; Abjuration 3): You create a general purpose ward.  <Thad, pg.
