It's a spirit of Intellect, and the Math teacher and a few others have attuned themselves to it\n    - No cults in the school\n    - The private school south of the Grove has something going on, not quite wrong, but a Something\n* Shortcuts through town with Danny which go from end to end\n    - Resonance sub-map on the Google Maps shows where the shortcuts are\n\n### This Session (IC, Ila)\n* This place is one, giant goddamn rift.  It's not a tear, reality has been worn through.  The Place on the Hill is the worst.\n* Others in town let me find cheap land.\n* A giant forest fire happened near the Rift.  It was contained, but all the houses in the area were lost.  No one died.\n* Mr. D. recruited people to deal with the Verge, refused pay, joined the Cool Kids Mage Group\n    - The other person who didn't want any money was an old guy herbalist who lives in the woods, litle naive.\n    - There was a grand realignment to ursurp the \"Mandate of Heaven, then thieves broke in and took the plans, shared them with this group, and then things unfolded\n    - Six places were affected (all hills) to create a pentagon (with a central location where the Verge lies) which focused the ritual.\n* Observed fae just randomly grabbing people.  Crew behaved admirably.\n    - Danny attempted to take the aggro.  Kudos to that one.\n\n* * * * *\n\n## 2018-12-05\n\n### Ila's IC Notes:\n* Met Danny, Timothy, Melville at the Chinese Food Shop, discussed the Shadowcritter issue -- plans were made\n    - Plans made to check on veteran with Danny\n    - Tried to help Timothy, Melville with a \"daring raid\"... but failed\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n## 2018-12-12\n\n### Ila's IC Notes:\n* Observing the Veteran:\n    - \"Charlie's Spot\"\n    - He's disconnected, not really involved\n    - The dark threads strangling him are small and muted, this is a slow burn effect\n* Danny has a flaming eagle as a familiar, left to him by his father\n\n### OOC Notes:\n* Incan Staff of Priviledge\n* Timothy and Melville had an adventure and a car chase\n\n\n* * * * *\n\n## 2018-12-19\n\n### Ila's IC Notes:\n* Ila got an earpiece, and met ERIC\n* Timothy picked up a Supernal artifact\n* Andros Iker is Timothy's father\n    - We met, went well, he is the more permissive parent who will lend grenades, Timothy's mother does care and will ground Timothy\n    - Established what level house protections were at, then found where improvements needed to occur\n\n\n* * * * * \n\n## 2018-12-26\n\n### Ila's IC Notes:\n\n* Dog with green eyes that circles exactly twice\n* Family came back to town\n* Went to the Library\n    - Wards notes:\n        + Art Noveau, protect from casual destruction -- seen in cast iron\n        + Next layer, protect from Cthulu\n        + 1930's, brutalist approach when The Man came to town, most likely when this place was updated for nukes, and added to existing wards\n            * In case of reality failure, this place will remain\n    - Equivilent to 4-dot Library merit\n    - Parts of Library:\n        + Government records from colonial era\n        + Card catalogue\n        + This is a library created by upper-crust occultists, colonialists\n        + Metal plates have inscriptions to remember things\n    - This is a Solid and Real place (via Prime)\n        + If something would call on the Supernal or cause Paradox, it would become lessened as a result of this place\n\n\n## 2019-01-30\n\nIla's OOC Notes:\n\n* Danny shot Timothy, and is a dumbass\n* Timothy got shot, and now his dad is *pissed*\n* Somehow, this is my problem\n\n## Other thing:\n* Bad Guy HR is named Rachel\n* Bad Guys split into two factions, and the Ursurper vs. Maintainer created a nightmare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
